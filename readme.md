# WeatherDump

Multi-platform software for record, demodulate, decode and process data from weather satellites.

## Supported Datalink Protocols

| Protocol | Complete Name | Satellites | Band | Support Level |
| -------- | ------------- | ---------- | ---- | ------------- |
| LRPT | Low Rate Picture Transfer | Meteor-MN2 | VHF | Alpha |
| HRD | High Rate Data | NOAA-20 & Suomi | X-Band | Beta |
| APT | Automatic Picture Transfer | NOAA-15, NOAA-18 & NOAA-19 | VHF | Planned (Beta 1) |

## Example Usage

Decoding and processing a Meteor-MN2 soft-symbol file:

```bash
weatherdump lrpt soft ./file_path.bin
```

## Known Bugs

- The LRPT RGB composite is unsynchonized in most occasions. Will be corrected in Beta 1.
- Garbage collection bug causes the app to use a huge amount of memory. Will be corrected in Beta 1.
